# PythonGames
All games were coded through VSC (Visual Studio Code). These games were developed through tutorials and guides and NOT 100% my work.
This repository is just simply demonstrating my desire to develop my ability to code in the language and is in functional order.

This repo contains 3 games.
1. Ping-Pong
2. Quiz
3. Hungry Snake

How to play:
Ping-Pong - the blue paddle operates on w,d keys.
            the red paddle operates on up and down arrows.
