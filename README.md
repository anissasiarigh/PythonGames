# PythonGames
All games were coded through VSC (Visual Studio Code). These games were developed via an online python for games course and NOT 100% my work but the code was adequately analysed for learning and understanding.
This repository is just simply demonstrating my desire to develop my ability to code in the language and is in functional order.

This repo contains 3 games.
1. Ping-Pong 🏓 
2. Quiz Master❓ 
3. Hungry Snake 🐍 

How to play:

Ping-Pong - the blue paddle operates on w,d keys.
The red paddle operates on up and down arrows.

Quiz Master & Hungry Snake are currently in development
